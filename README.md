# KGrid
A KWin script that brings WindowsGrid-like window management to KDE Plasma.
This script allows you to divide your desktop into grid-based regions and quickly snap windows into them â€” emulating the smooth workflow of WindowsGrid, but natively within KDE.

## About 
This project is a fork of the original [kTile](https://github.com/51n7/kTile) by it's creator (many thanks!). While kTile introduced powerful grid snapping through KWin scripting, this fork is more close to original behavior and user experience of WindowsGrid on Linux/KDE.
